{% include base_path %}

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Regional Science in the City and Regional Planning Department at Cornell University. My primary research interests include Labor Economics, Economics of Immigration, Regional Economics, Agriculture Economics, and Applied Econometrics. I am particularly interested in the socioeconomic and fiscal effects of sudden immigration shocks in the developing world, the adoption of GMO alternatives in the production of Chocolate, and the use of IO, SAM, and SPA modeling and its applications across sectors such as mining and agriculture. I expect to graduate in Spring 2023.
