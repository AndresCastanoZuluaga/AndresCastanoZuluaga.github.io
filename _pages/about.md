I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics in the Department of Economics at Cornell University.  My primary research interests include Labor Economics and the Economics of Education.   I have a particular interest in teacher selection and incentives to maximize student outcomes.   I expect to graduate in Spring 2022.
