I am an Assistant Teaching Professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar Ph.D.. I teach economics and business analytics courses: Macroeconomics, Emerging Markets, and End-to-End Analytics. My primary research interests include Labor Economics, Economics of Immigration, Regional Economic Impact Analysis, and Applied Econometrics. I am particularly interested in the socioeconomic and fiscal effects of sudden immigration shocks in the developing world on the receiving countries' labor and housing markets and public finances. I am also interested in the implementation of experimental, quasi-experimental, and Input-Ouput methods to understand and evaluate the effects of policies, programs, and business decisions on regional economic growth across different sectors and identify opportunities at the local level that could spur regional growth through business development and workforce attraction and retention. Recently, I was awarded the SEED Research from Qatar Foundation to conduct research regarding the diversification and complexity of the economic structure across Guldf countries from 2000 to 2000.
