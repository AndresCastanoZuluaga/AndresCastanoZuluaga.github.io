{% include base_path %}

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Regional Science in the City and Regional Planning Department. My primary research interests include Labor Economics, Economics of Immigration, Regional Economics, and Agriculture Economics. I am particularly interested in the socioeconomic and fiscal effects of sudden immigration shocks in the developing world, the willingness to pay for GMO chocolate, and the use of IO, SAM, and SPA models to understand the regional economic effects of investments across a variety of sectors including mining and agriculture. I expect to graduate in Spring 2023.
