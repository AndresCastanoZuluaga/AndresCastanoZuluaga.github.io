I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at Cornell University. My primary research interests include Labor Economics and the Economics of Education with work on K-12 teacher tenure, predictive models of teacher performance, returns to university STEM programs, and major league baseball aging curves.  I have a particular interest in teacher selection and incentives to maximize student outcomes. In addition, I am passionate about teaching.  In fact, I earned a high school mathematics teacher certification in New Jersey.  I expect to graduate in Spring 2022.
