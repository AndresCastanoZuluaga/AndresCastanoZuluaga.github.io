<div> The Effects of Teacher Tenure and Job Security on Performance</div> <br>
<div>This study examines the costs and benefits of tenure by leveraging quasi-experimental variation from the 2012 Teacher Effectiveness and Accountability for the Children of New Jersey (TEACHNJ) Act. This law lengthened the time needed to earn tenure from three years to four years. I estimate the causal impact of teacher tenure on teacher motivation, as measured by value-added and teacher evaluations. A differences-in-differences model estimates the effect of tenure by comparing fourth-year tenured teachers (hired before TEACHNJ) to fourth-year pretenured teachers (hired after TEACHNJ). If there is reduced effort in response to tenure, tenured teachers would have lower value-added than pretenured teachers conditional on experience. I also study changes in the teacher labor market in response to the policy change. </div><br>

<div>Risks and Rewards: The Returns to STEM Programs for Less-Prepared Students, with Evan Riehl</div><br>
<div>We examine how returns to enrolling in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) programs vary with students’ academic preparation. We match data on STEM admissions at a Colombian flagship university to nationwide college and earnings records. Our identification strategy combines a regression discontinuity design with variation in admission quotas. We find that less-prepared students were less likely to complete a STEM degree than their more able peers, but they had larger earnings returns to enrolling. Thus less-prepared students may face a stark risk/reward tradeoff in pursuing STEM degrees, which has implications for policies that promote STEM enrollment.</div> <br>

<div>This study models player performance as a function of age, experience, and talent. The unbalanced panel includes 5,754 seasons spread among 562 batters and 4,767 seasons spread among 489 pitchers. Peak physical age for hitters and pitchers are 26.6 years and 24.5 years, respectively, when holding experience constant. With increased experience, batters peak near age 29, while pitchers peak near age 28. Also, batters encounter greater fluctuations in performance over their careers than pitchers. This model is designed for use by MLB teams to predict future performance based on a player’s first six years of statistics. </div>
