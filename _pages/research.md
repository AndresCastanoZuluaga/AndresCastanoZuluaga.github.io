<div>  
In this paper, we reexamine the effect of immigration on public finances by addressing these second-order effects. Specifically, we look at labor displacement, changes in factor prices (labor and capital), and changes in the allocation and cost of providing public services. To guide our empirical analysis, we present a simple theoretical framework that allows us to derive the implications of changes in population driven by increasing immigration on natives’ net fiscal contributions. We use this framework to explain differences in fiscal contributions for natives and set the ground for exploring the mechanisms in place. We show that the effect of increasing immigrant inflows on the net fiscal contributions of native workers depends on three terms. First, a factor price effect that captures changes in taxes paid that result from both labor displacement and variations in wages, as part of the labor market adjustment, and changes in revenue from capital income. Second, the change in the cost of government service provision. This cost effect may be driven by the mix of goods and services provided (pure, congested, or private goods), changes in the composition of the population, and the overall increase in the local population. Third, changes in the composition of government expenditures and differences in the demand for government services between natives and immigrants.

We exploit exogenous variation in immigration across Colombian metropolitan areas between 2013 and 2018, resulting from the large increase in Venezuelan immigrants, and instrument immigrants’ residential location using pre- existing settlement patterns and the distance between origin-destination flows. We find that immigration did not reduce natives’ average fiscal contributions. Exploring the mechanisms in place, we document that immigration had no effect on employment, average wages in the upper half of the wage distribution, or hours worked that would have explained changes in labor-driven tax contributions. In addition, immigration did not trigger a decline in property values, and we find no evidence of changes in the composition of local public spending or costs being distributed among a larger population. This suggests that the composition of public expenditures is biased towards services that are rival in consumption and thus increase with population. Results in this paper indicate that, even when finding evidence of labor displacement or negative factor prices, immigration does not necessarily reduce natives’ average tax contributions.

potential shortage of chocolate? A hedonic and willingness to pay study for different varieties of Ecuadorian chocolate </a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px"> with Miguel Gomez </p> </div> <br>
<div> 
Chocolate has been experiencing a significant increase in demand during the last two decades. However, the current powerful boost in demand and the expectations of an even higher one might not be accompanied by an equal increase in supply. Cacao, the main component of chocolate and the one that gives its texture and flavor, faces various threats, from climate change and fungal diseases to political instability in production regions worldwide. One potential solution to the shortage of chocolate is expanding or promoting certain hybrids that have shown good yield and disease resistance. One of the most promising solutions to the cacao shortage might be the CCN-51 cacao hybrid. We used an auction experiment to study the hedonic properties and the factors affecting the WTP for Ecuadorian chocolate produced with different cacao, including the CCN-51 cacao hybrid. We find that smell ratings favored the highest quality cacao compared to the CCN-51 hybrid; however, there were no differences in taste ratings. We also find no difference in mean WTP between the national variety and the CCN-51 cacao hybrid, even when information on the quality and nutritional value of the cacao was provided. Results suggest the expansion in the use of CCN-51 cacao in chocolate production is a plausible alternative to deal with the potential shortage of chocolate.

<div><a href="http://kevincng.github.io/files/Kevin_Ng_Predicting_Performance.pdf">  Identifying High-Quality Teachers </a> </div> <br> 
<div>  
This study evaluates techniques to identify high-quality teachers.  Since tenure restricts dismissals of experienced teachers, schools must predict productivity and dismiss those expected to perform ineffectively prior to tenure receipt.  Many states solely rely on evaluation scores to guide these personnel decisions without considering other dimensions of teacher performance. For example, New Jersey uses summative ratings, which primarily rely on supervisor evaluations. I use various predictive models to rank teachers based on predicted value-added and summative ratings.  I then simulate revised personnel decisions and test for changes in average retained teacher performance.  In this exercise, I adjust two factors that impact the quality of the predictions: the number of predictors and the length of the pretenure period.  Both factors impact the precision of the predictions, though extended pretenure periods also may negatively impact selection into teaching.  I find that revised algorithms using both value-added and summative ratings increase the average value-added of retained teachers by 0.01 standard deviations without decreasing summative ratings or diversity.  This Pareto improvement equates to a present value gain of $2,240 per student.    These returns are a product of using additional information rather than advanced algorithms, as I generate similar gains when using simple ordinary least squares regressions or advanced machine learning techniques.  In comparison, algorithms that extend the pretenure period beyond one year do not provide enough additional information to significantly improve average retained teacher performance unless dismissal rates increase dramatically.

<div>This study models player performance as a function of age, experience, and talent. The unbalanced panel includes 5,754 seasons spread among 562 batters and 4,767 seasons spread among 489 pitchers. Peak physical age for hitters and pitchers are 26.6 years and 24.5 years, respectively, when holding experience constant. With increased experience, batters peak near age 29, while pitchers peak near age 28. Also, batters encounter greater fluctuations in performance over their careers than pitchers. This model is designed for use by MLB teams to predict future performance based on a player’s first six years of statistics. </div>
