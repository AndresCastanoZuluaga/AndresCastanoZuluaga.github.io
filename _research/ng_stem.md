title: "Risks and Rewards: The Returns to STEM Programs for Less-Prepared Students"
collection: research
permalink: /research/ng_stem
excerpt: 'We examine how returns to enrolling in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) programs vary with studentsâ€™ academic preparation. We match data on STEM admissions at a Colombian flagship university to nationwide college and earnings records. Our identification strategy combines a regression discontinuity design with variation in admission quotas. We find that less-prepared students were less likely to complete a STEM degree than their more able peers, but they had larger earnings returns to enrolling. Thus less-prepared students may face a stark risk/reward tradeoff in pursuing STEM degrees, which has implications for policies that promote STEM enrollment.'
