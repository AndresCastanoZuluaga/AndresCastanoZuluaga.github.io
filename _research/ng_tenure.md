title: "The Effect of Teacher Tenure and Job Security on Performance"
collection: research
permalink: /research/ng_tenure
excerpt: 'This study examines the costs and benefits of tenure by leveraging quasi-experimental variation from the 2012 Teacher Effectiveness and Accountability for the Children of New Jersey (TEACHNJ) Act. This law lengthened the time needed to earn tenure from three years to four years. I estimate the causal impact of teacher tenure on teacher motivation, as measured by value-added and teacher evaluations. A differences-in-differences model estimates the effect of tenure by comparing fourth-year tenured teachers (hired before TEACHNJ) to fourth-year pretenured teachers (hired after TEACHNJ). If there is reduced effort in response to tenure, tenured teachers would have lower value-added than pretenured teachers conditional on experience. I also conduct a Regression Discontinuity Design relying on discontinuities in job security around evaluation score thresholds to estimate tenure's effects on lower performing teachers later in their careers. Finally, the study evaluates changes in the teacher labor market in response to the policy change.'
